</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Next, process the following commands in Terminal window at mysql&gt; prompt</li>

</ul>




tee <strong>solution4.rpt</strong>;         source <strong>task4.sql</strong>;

notee;







to submit a script <strong>task4.sql</strong> for processing by MySQL and to save a report from processing of the script in a file solution4.rpt.  Do not delete a file <strong>solution4.rpt</strong>.  It will be submitted as one of the deliverables from your laboratory work.




tee <strong>solution4.rpt</strong> command copies the messages and results displayed on a screen into a text file, in this case into solution2.rpt file. notee command stops copying the messages and results displayed on a screen to a file.




source <strong>task4.sql</strong> command sends SQL statements included in script file <strong>task4.sql</strong> for processing by MySQL database server.







<h3>Deliverables</h3>

A file <strong>solution4.png and solution4.rpt</strong> that contains a saved screen image with the results from processing of a script <strong>task4.sql</strong>.




<strong>Task 5 (0.5 mark) </strong>

An objective of this task is to learn how to use a graphical user interface (GUI) MySQL Workbench to create and to process SQL scripts.




Before implementation of this task it is strongly recommended to read from the Cookbook all steps of Recipe 3.2 “How to use a graphical interface to MySQL database server?”.




It is assumed that after implementation of Task 4 your appliance is up and running. If not, then start VirtualBox, import your appliance, and run it.




Perform the following steps.




<ul>

 <li>Power on a virtual machine Ubuntu18.04-64bits-MySQL8.0.13-07NOV-2018. It is explained in Cookbook, Recipe 1.1 Step 4 “How to power on a virtual machine ?” how to power on a virtual machine.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>When Ubuntu 18.04 operating system displays an orange box with a name of CSIT115 user press Enter key and then type csit115 into a Password field.  Then, wait until operating system displays a column of icons on the left-hand side of a screen</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>To start MySQL Workbench graphical interface click at a blue icon with a silhouette of a white dolphin.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Next, click at a small “+” sign located after “MySQL Connections” string to create a new connection. Type into a field Connection Name your connection name, into a field Username csit115, and into a field Default Schema csit115.</li>

</ul>

Finally, click at OK button.




<ul>

 <li>To open your new connection left click at a rectangle that represents a new connection in a front panel of MySQL Workbench. Next, type in a password:</li>

</ul>

csit115 of csit115 database user and click at OK button.




<ul>

 <li>Type into Query 1 sub window the following lines.</li>

</ul>




CREATE TABLE CUSTOMER(name    VARCHAR (30) NOT NULL,

(id          INTEGER(4) NOT NULL);




INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES(‘Jimmy, 1234);

INSERT INTO CUSTOMER VALUES(‘Mary’,456);




COMMIT;




SELECT * , NOW();

FROM CUSTOMER;

<ul>

 <li>Save the text typed in the previous step as SQL script in a file <strong>sql</strong>. To do so either use File-&gt;Save Script As … menus or “floppy disk” icon in Query 1 sub window (the 2nd icon from left, btw do you know what is a “floppy disk”? ). Do not delete a file <strong>task5.sql</strong>. You will submit it as one of the deliverables from your laboratory work</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>To submit a script for processing by MySQL database server left click at the first line of a script and later on left click at “yellow lightning” icon just above a workspace with the script. You should get the results of processing in a workspace below. If the results do not show up you may have to expand the sub windows with the results and the messages. To do so, move a cursor to a bottom line of sub window <strong>task5</strong> with a text of a <strong>script task5.sql</strong> to a location where a cursor changes its shape to a vertical double (up and down) arrow. Then press a left button and while it is pressed move a cursor up. Repeat such procedure for both results and messages sub windows. You may need to ask a tutor about help.</li>

</ul>




<ul>

 <li>Note, that it is also possible to process a single SQL statement from your script independently on the other statements. To do so, left click at one of INSERT statements and then left click at “yellow lightning” icon with a silhouette of “white cursor” just above a workspace with the script (the 4th icon from left). A technique of processing the individual SQL statements in one-by-one mode is very useful at the debugging stages.</li>

</ul>




(9) When ready shrink a window with VirtualBox and save screen image in a file <strong>solution5.png</strong> in the same way as you did it in a Task 3.




Make sure that the results from processing of a script <strong>task5.sql</strong> are visible in an image. Do not delete a file <strong>solution5.png</strong>. It will be submitted at the end of laboratory exercise.




<h3>Deliverables</h3>

A file <strong>solution5.png</strong> that contains a saved screen image with the results from processing of a script <strong>task5.sql</strong>.
